    <p>My name is (insert name here) and I would like to be your future web developer! Or, y'know, whatever all the languages will get me. Really flexible on that one. The job title could literally be anything, just as long I get to use the skills I've learned here. Here being the KU Edwards Campus, being taught by Triology Educational Services.</p>
    
    <p>Other than that, I'm just a dude who really likes nerdy things that my friends say I should never put on a dating profile. Also, I like pie and I have a dog named Sadie. She's super cute. Here's a link to some pictures of her.</p>

    <p>I was also very self conscious of all the blank space I was leaving on the page, so I was hoping that me gushing about some of the things happening this year should help kill some of that. First off, there's a new set of Pokemon games, which is super dope. Next on my list would be My Hero Academia season 4, which is by far my favorite shonen anime at the moment. And then, finally, there is the still fresh news that THQ Nordic is remastering Spongebob Squarepants: Battle for Bikini Bottom. I know what you're thinking. "Nick, why are you excited for a Spongebob game made 15+ years ago? Why are you being so childish?" Well, Dave, how about you get off your high horse? Nobody batted an eye whenever your triassic self lost it whenever they remade Punch Out for the umpteenth time. Chillax, Dave.</p>
